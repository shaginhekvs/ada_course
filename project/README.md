#Title
What’s the oxygen for mass movements? 

#Abstract

The media coverage triggers and facilitates the spreading of protests. In particular, we are interested in looking at key factors that contributed to the creation of mass movements US after the deaths of black people. Why did the death of two young black men, one in Ferguson and one in New York City resulted in the international movement Black Lives Matter?  Many big scale campaigns started from isolated salient events. We are interested in finding patterns giving insights to why some events lead to protests versus why others did not and how they spread across the US, and in some cases, across the world.
Research questions

•	Are there key triggers for any mass movement, specifically protests related to black people being killed in the US ? If yes, what distinguishes this key event from other events in terms of its news coverage or gravity / public sentiment / network inter-relations ?
•	Can patterns in such events be used to predict protests in the US similar to Black Lives Matters ?
•	By studying the propagation of protests across US and the coverage given in the news and around the world to such protests, can we predict the impact or success of this movement ? 
•	Identify if key events or people can be identified in an event and whether the eventual outcome of an event rests on either of the 2 factors , and if yes then is it the former or the latter ? 


#Dataset

We are planning on using the GDELT dataset, selecting the events, news and information related to black people being killed in the US and the protests that were generated as a consequence. The GDELT GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (GKG) contains news that are annotated with a category (i.e. protest) and a location they are from. Moreover, the news are annotated with Data Mentions, which would allow us to track how the events progressed over time and the Proximity Content, which would allow us to relate the event to key companies, people and other events. As well as that, news are also annotated with sentiment analysis.	

Additionally, complement the information with the Guns dataset from Homework 0, selecting the data related to deaths of black people.

Collect data from the GDELT and GKG datasets filter out the data and news related to events related to black people being killed and the protests generated
Make the data processing pipeline and make preliminary analysis if the necessary parameters for testing our hypothesis.
Study and select some protests related to this subject as cases of study



#Questions for TA

Can we use the gunshots deaths dataset from homework 0?
Can we use the cluster’s compute to process our models ?
What’s the meaning of number 42 ?
